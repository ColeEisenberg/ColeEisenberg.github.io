description: After an acute wrist injury—and my reluctance to see a doctor—I decided to solve the problem on my own. Using the LiDAR on my cellphone as a scanner, I scanned my wrist and uploaded the shape into my CAD software. I quickly designed this brace, which I then 3D-printed. After two iterations, the device was comfortable enough to wear for days on end and took less than an hour to print.
