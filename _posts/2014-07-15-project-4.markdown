description: After an acute wrist injury and my reluctance to go see a doctor, I decided to fix the problem on my own. Using the LIDAR on my cellphone as a scanner, I uploaded the shape into my CAD software and quickly whipped this up with my 3D printer. The second rendition was comfortable enough to wear for days on end, and printed in less than an hour.
