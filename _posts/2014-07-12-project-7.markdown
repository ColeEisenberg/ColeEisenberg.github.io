description: I love cars! Say hello to my '01 Corvette. I bought it back in January 2021, and I've kept busy maintaining and upgrading this beauty.

paragraph1: While commuting to school, I noticed my clutch was having trouble staying disengaged when actuated (the system wasn't holding pressure). Following normal troubleshooting procedures, I started with the easiest solutions. No luck with a fluid bleed. Changing the master cylinder didn’t solve the problem either. The only possible culprit left was the slave cylinder, which required removing the rear subframe/transaxle assembly and sliding the torque tube away from the back of the motor. Once I had it apart, I swapped out the part and decided to replace the clutch and flywheel as well—since I didn’t want to do this job again anytime soon! After spending my entire spring break on my back in the driveway, my transmission never felt so smooth.

paragraph2: Working on projects like removing the intake manifold to replace the oil pressure sensor, jacking up the motor to install long tube headers, and countless other tasks has continuously honed my mechanical aptitude. Each challenge pushes me to think critically and sharpen my skills with every turn of the wrench.
