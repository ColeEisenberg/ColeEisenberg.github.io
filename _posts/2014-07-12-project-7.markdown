paragraph1: While commuting to school, I noticed my clutch was having issues with staying disengaged when actuated. Following normal troubleshoooting procedure, I started with the easiest solutions first. No luck with a fluid bleed. Changing the master cylinder didnt solve the problem. From here, the only possile culprit was the slave cylinfer, which in order to get to, I needed to remove the rear subframe/transaxle assembly and slide the torque-tube away from the backside of the motor. From here, I was able to swap out the part and change the clutch and flywheel, since I really didn't feel like doing this again anytime soon. After spending my entire spring break on my back in the driveway, my transmission never felt so smooth.

paragraph2: From taking off the intake mainfold to change the oil pressure sensor to jacking up the motor for enough space to slide in long tube headers, working on this car keeps me thinking critically.
