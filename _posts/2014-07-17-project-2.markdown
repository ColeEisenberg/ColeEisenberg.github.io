description: The first robot build of my university career made me fall in love with electronics. The robot featured a differential drive using two DC motors, controlled by an Arduino interfacing with a cell phone app and sending signals to an H-bridge. Masks were loaded, rubber bands cocked, and two finite rotation servos launched them on command. This project introduced me to programming microcontrollers and taught me the importance of always checking your grounds.
