description: The first robot build of my university career, made me fall in love with electronics. The robot had differential drive through the two DC motors, controlled by an arduino interfacing to a cell phone app and sending signals to an h-bridge. Masks are loaded, rubber bands cocked, and the two finite rotation servos let them rip on command. This project introduced me to programming microcontrollers and taught me to always check your grounds.
