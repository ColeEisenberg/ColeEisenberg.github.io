description: The goal was to design a simple garden shed and create a management plan for the entire project. I developed the project schedule, staffing requirements, manufacturing processes, and optimized all associated costs. I ended up enjoying this assignment more than anticipated; it was satisfying to create an efficient, all-encompassing plan for my theoretical company.
