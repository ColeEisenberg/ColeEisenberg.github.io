description: This mechatronics project uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control the position of trim tabs on a model boat, helping to stabilize it in rough water. A decoder takes 3 inputs from the MCU and drives 8 LEDs to display the position of the servos. The ESP32 also broadcasts system vitals over a WiFi channel, allowing the user to monitor data via a proprietary smartphone app. Depending on the operator-selected mode, either button presses or accelerometer readings are used to control the servos.

paragraph1: This is a Fritzing schematic of the system. In practice, an additional Arduino Uno was added to supply sufficient current to the servos.

paragraph3: Notice how when the acceloremoter is in control, the LEDs, smartphone app, and trim tabs act accordingly.
