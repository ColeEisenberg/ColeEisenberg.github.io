description: This mechatronics project automates the positioning of trim tabs based on the position of an accelorometer. A decoder take 4 inputs from the ESP32 and uses it to drive 8 LEDs and display what the accelorometer is reading. The ESP32 is also broadcasting the vitals over WiFi, allowoing for the user to read system data on a smart phone app.
