description: After 33 CAD joints and relationships, I present to you the Vegetable-Chopper-9000. This novel design uses a simple movement mechanism and features a custom-designed cam lobe that drives the chopping motion. The cam was carefully engineered to ensure smooth operation, avoiding excessive pressure angles and accelerations. The hand crank powers both the conveyor belt and a gear train, which would theoretically slice whatever you feed into even pieces, the size is determined by the gear ratios.
