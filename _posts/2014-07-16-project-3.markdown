description: 100 CAD movement relationships later, I present to you the vegetable chopper 9000. A novel design using a simple movement mechanism, this project exibits a custom designed cam lobe which drives the chopping motion. The hand crank drives the conveyor belt and a gear train, which would theoretically chop whatever you choose to feed ths beast into even __cm pieces.
