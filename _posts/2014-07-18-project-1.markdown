description: As a member of the senior design team, I was tasked with redesigning the electric propulsion system of our solar boat. I collaborated closely with the steering team to ensure our designs were compatible. Working within a tight budget and schedule, we designed and fabricated all the mechanical, electrical, and electronic systems.
