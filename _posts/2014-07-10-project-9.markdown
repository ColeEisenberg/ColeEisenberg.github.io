description: Spreading across many fields of engineering, this project has been keeping me busy. Packaging contraints, energy consumption optimization and general problem solving have kept my mind sharp since graduation. The project is based around an ESP32 and runs on micropython, which then talks to an iPhone appliation over bluetooth.
